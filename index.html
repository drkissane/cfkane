			 <p>I headed up to Saint Cyr and got started a little closer to the trailhead. A couple of kilometers to warm up and then onto the rocky trail up towards the Mont Thou. The ground was wet and heavy, with increasingly slippery mud on the way uphill. Closing in on the final push to Mont Thou it got to the point where there was no grip at all - time to change shoes? - and a barbed wire fence on the left hand side of the trail. Slip here and I could make a mess of things, so I found my way onto a parallel road and made the final few hundred meters a little bit easier. Turning around, it was all downhill - if muddy and a little too slippery for my liking - on the way home. Back through Saint Cyr, down to Saint Rambert, and finished things off at the supermarket because the wife needed soda.</p>

<li>Fastest: 3:55 (flat, running for time)</li>
<li>Slowest: 7:13 (hilly, muddy, trails, night)</li>
<li>Average: 5:16</li>
</ul>
<p>The 15 efforts fit into what I think of as six broad &lsquo;bands&rsquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint: 1 - 3:55</li>
<li>Strong: 6 - 4:24, 4:26, 4:33, 4:41, 4:47, 4:47</li>
<li>Solid: 3 - 5:04, 5:05, 5:11</li>
<li>OK: 1 - 5:34</li>
<li>Slow: 3 - 6:29, 6:31, 6:32</li>
<li>Very Slow: 1 - 7:13</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, if I could run a 50K now in 5 hours I would be happy. Sneaking in under 5 hours would be a great result moving into 2023, especially if unsupported/outside of a race.</p>

			 <p>A day of meetings, workshops, and a client dinner meant I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to fit in a run - or at least not a long one. I decided to go for speed over distance and get back home from the school drop-off fast. It was only 22-ish minutes but worth it to get the legs turning over before a day that will be spent mostly sitting down.</p>

			 <p>Started out in Couzon in the fog and headed straight up an old cycling route that I know. At the top of the climb I hit the trails and made my way up to Mont Thou. The higher I got, the muddier the trails got and while I didn&rsquo;t slip over, it was moving underfoot for the last 15 minutes of the climb. A photo at the top and then a quick descent to Saint Cyr with a couple of muddy sections. The final three kilometers home were smooth and the legs turned over nicely before I jumped into a warm shower and work.</p>

			 <p>Wasn&rsquo;t feeling amazing when I set out for the run after dropping the kid at school and so my mind was set on a recovery run. It&rsquo;s 4km back to home directly so a few laps of the track at Collonges and a roundabout way back and I should be able to do a half hour or 45 minutes of flat-ish roads. A quick toilet break at the Collonges track, though, and I felt better and so I decided to close out the Strava Climbing Challenge for the month with the final 259m I needed. It ended up being a touch over 300m of climbing and I came back a little muddy but a lot happier.</p>
